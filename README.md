# Portfolio Website

I'm a full-stack software engineer, and this is v1 of my portfolio site. Coming soon in v2: mobile responsiveness and expanded sections to showcase the details of my experience, education, tech skills, etc.   

### Technology
The boilerplate for the site was generated with Vite, and the rest was coded from scratch with **React, TypeScript, and CSS**. No templates, AI agents, or copy-pasted code. AI is an incredible tool for efficiency, and I happily used it for spellchecking, inline code autocompletion, debugging, syntax lookup, and creative ideation. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, and the deployment is managed through GitHub Actions. 

I had a great time learning about a lot of topics that I never had the opportunity to dive deep into before. These include:
- Creating and manipulating custom SVGs
- Coding custom animations  
*I used a combination of simple transitions, keyframe animations, and CSS View Transitions tweaked for React.* 
- Web responsiveness  
*This is still a work in progress, but I tried to do as much of this without breakpoints as possible, instead leveraging text sizes, padding, images, etc., that were inherently scalable. Conditional rendering based on screen size was done with [react-responsive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive).*

### Build Process
I wanted to use this portfolio build as more than just a digital resume or technical showcase. The features I'm building here are not as complex as the ones I would create in my professional work, but I tried to make this process as realistic as possible by recreating a lot of the professional infrastructure that I typically have when I work.

I created the designs for my site in **Figma** and pushed myself to not start coding until the main layouts and design choices were set. As someone who particularly enjoys frontend work, this design process was really important to me and helped me be much more efficient when I later put on my developer hat. At the time of writing, I have 70+ Figma designs and have actually spent more time designing than coding for this project. No knock on portfolio sites that use templates, but I hope you all appreciate the extra effort that went into creating something from scratch. Similarly, I kept myself organized by creating **Jira** tickets for all features, research tasks, bugs, etc., and using those ticket numbers to link requirements to branches in GitHub.

### Issues
If you encounter a bug, typo, or inconsistency, or you have a suggestion for how to improve this website in any way, I would love to hear from you! I am still actively developing the site, adding features, and improving the code. Shoot me an email at contact@coleflournoy.dev or open an issue in the repo.
